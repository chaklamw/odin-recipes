        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If your hungry and need something to fill you up, fried rice 
            can do exactly that! It's a perfect lunch and dinner option 
            as it has carbs, vegetables and protein. It won't take long
            to prepare either. However, it should be noted that this is
            not an everyday dish.
